[UNSUPPORTED] Bank Integration
==============================

From 2009 until 2014, Kinento has sold the Magento Bank Integration module for 229 euro per license. From 2015 onwards, updates are no longer provided by Kinento, but the module is instead available on GitHub free of charge. The code is released under the MIT open-source license and community patches and feature additions are encouraged.

Included is the original PDF manual (manual.pdf) and the Magento Connect description (below).

Module description
================

With Kinento's Bank Integration module, transactions from your bank account are automatically coupled to Magento's order system. Bank Integration searches for paid orders and updates the order status according to the transaction amount, processing payments automatically: You'll never have to check for paid orders manually anymore! 

Automatic bank-to-Magento coupling
-------------

With Bank Integration, the coupling of bank transactions and unpaid orders is based on both the bank description and the transaction amount. When handling with insufficient data, Bank Integration provides an easy to use manual coupling system as a back-up. Payments made through your bank will be visible in Magento's back-end, giving a complete order/payment overview. 

Bank support
-------------

If your bank includes an export-to-file feature, Bank Integration can automatically couple bank transactions to orders. The module can be customized to support your bank (see Bankintegration/Model/Banks.php). 

Bank Integration: since 2009
-------------

Bank Integration has been customized, fine-tuned, and updated since its first version in 2009. It includes wide compatibility, added functionality, and many configuration options, all part of customer's feature requests since 2009.
